# FetReg---Placental-Vessel-Segmentation-in-Fetoscopy

Automatic Placental Vessel Segmentation based on Ensemble Recursive DenslyUnet deep learning model
We have proposed different 2D encoder and decoder based modesl for placental vessel segmentation.
Please downlaad the dataset from FetReg - Placental Vessel Segmentation and Registration in Fetoscopy challenge website.

step1: Split dataset into training and validation using random cross validation approach. I have also provided csv files for 
5-k fold.

setp2: Please check the DataLoader_Vis for data visualization and batch-processing

step3: Define the model

step4: Train and validate the model

step5: Predict the ensmeble model and apply test time augmentation

Referenece: Please cite the dataset
